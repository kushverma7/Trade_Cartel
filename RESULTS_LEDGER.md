# RESULTS LEDGER

**Every backtest result on record, in one table.** Built 2026-07-29 by
extracting every result mention from `trader_playbooks/PLAYBOOK.md` and the
recovered session archive.

## Why this file exists

Before it, results lived as prose scattered across 1,097 lines of PLAYBOOK.md
— 19 separate PF mentions, of which only ~12 recorded a trade count and only
5 recorded the date range tested. There was no way to answer "what did engine
X score, on what sample, with what settings" without re-reading the whole
file. That is a large part of why 17 engines got built and none got validated:
the comparison was never actually available.

**Rules for this file**
1. Every row records the sample, not just the headline. A PF with no trade
   count and no date range is not a result.
2. `Unknown` means unknown. Do not infer, do not backfill from memory.
3. Nothing gets a `VALID` status without an out-of-sample test. As of this
   file's creation, **no row qualifies** — that is the finding.
4. New results are appended here in the session they are produced.

## What the ledger says when you read it as one table

- **16 runs. Zero out-of-sample tests. Zero valid rows.**
- Two of the three results above PF 1.0 are already dead: #2 retracted for
  sample size, #15 void as an execution artifact. Only #13 survives, and it
  is one in-sample window with a confound (logic and timeframe both changed).
- Rows 9–12 are the plateau: four different architectures, same Jun–Jul 5m
  window, PF 0.819–0.886. Four distinct entry mechanisms converging on the
  same losing number is evidence about the **timeframe**, not the mechanisms.
- Rows 1–8 mostly lack trade counts and date ranges entirely. They cannot be
  compared to anything. Roughly half the project's recorded history is
  unusable as evidence.
- Every window ≤ 07-27 is Jun–Jul only — a ~2-month sample, because of the
  free-plan data cap. Row 13 was the first time a real sample was tested.

## Settings for the results that had them recorded

**#6 Top/Bottom, PF-analog 1.11** (recovered 2026-07-29 from the session
archive — these existed nowhere in the repo before):
```
useTestFail  = false      closePosPct = 0.2       rsiOb = 72
rsiOs        = 31         useTrendVeto = false    cooldown = 20
minReArmAtr  = 1.5
```
User confirmation, verbatim: *"oversold is 31 rest is as told"*.

**#13 Multi-Voice, PF 1.093:** `minScore = 6`, `weightHigh = true`, all 20
voters on, defaults elsewhere. Group ⑤/⑥ did not exist yet.

## Standing conclusions the table supports

1. **Trend / HTF filters have failed three times.** #12 (HTF bias MA, 0.882 →
   0.819), the ADX veto, and `useTrendVeto` on #6. Three strikes.
2. **A suspiciously low trade count is an execution symptom.** #15 looked
   like a 1.783 edge and was rejected orders. #7 looked like a strategy
   failure and was also plumbing.
3. **The plateau is the finding.** Rows 9–12 say XAUUSD 5m does not support
   these mechanisms after costs. Kronos was acquired to test that directly
   and is still blocked on HuggingFace being firewalled.

## Overfitting audit — 2026-07-29

Ran the Deflated Sharpe Ratio (Bailey & Lopez de Prado; implementation ported
from stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading) over the ledger itself.
Reproduce with `python3 -m backtest.audit_ledger`.

Per-trade Sharpe reconstructed from (PF, WR, n) for every row that recorded
all three. **The reconstruction assumes uniform win and loss sizes, which
makes it optimistic — these are upper bounds, not measurements.**

| Row | n | PF | SR/trade |
|---|---|---|---|
| #6 Top/Bottom run 4 | 112 | 1.110 | +0.0492 |
| #9 OMNIBUS four-model | 298 | 0.843 | −0.0850 |
| #10 Key-to-Key | 245 | 0.886 | −0.0547 |
| #11 Trendline × Key Levels | 382 | 0.882 | −0.0623 |
| **#13 Multi-Voice** | **521** | **1.093** | **+0.0439** |
| #14 MV + level-to-level | 461 | 0.892 | −0.0551 |
| #15 Key Levels v1.0 (void) | 22 | 1.783 | +0.2932 |

### The result

| trials assumed | E[max SR] from noise | adjusted SR | DSR |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 (ledger rows only) | 0.0809 | −0.0370 | **0.20** |
| 17 (every engine built) | 0.1066 | −0.0627 | **0.08** |
| 40 (engines × parameter passes) | 0.1277 | −0.0838 | **0.03** |

*(excluding the void 22-trade row, which inflates trial variance; including
it every figure drops below 0.001. The verdict is the same either way.)*

**DSR needs to reach ~0.95 to count as evidence of skill. The best result
this repo has ever produced reaches 0.08 at a realistic trial count.**

The expected maximum Sharpe from running 17 attempts on data with no edge is
**0.107 per trade**. The Multi-Voice engine achieved **0.044**. It did not
merely fail to beat the noise threshold — it came in at less than half of it.

### What this actually settles

PF 1.093 is not a small edge that needs more tuning. Once the number of
attempts is accounted for, it is **below what pure chance would have handed
us anyway**. Every "the plateau is close to 1.0, keep pushing" reading of the
last four months was wrong, and the ledger now says so quantitatively.

**The bar to clear:** at 17 trials and n=521, a result needs SR/trade ≥ 0.179,
which at a 44% win rate is roughly **PF 1.45**. Not 1.10. Anything between
1.0 and ~1.4 on this sample size is indistinguishable from search noise and
should not be built on.

## Row 19 — the first out-of-sample positive, and why it was rejected (2026-07-31)

First real dataset: 157,366 bars of XAUUSD 15m, Dec 2019 – Jul 2026, split
60/40 at 2023-11-28. The optimiser selected levels PMH/NYH/NYL on the
training half and the held-out block returned **PF 1.495 on n=60, +16.96%**.

Profit factor went UP out of sample. It looked like the breakthrough.
It is not. `python3 -m backtest.stress_test` failed it on all three gates.

### Gate 1 — random null at the MATCHED sample size: FAIL

Coin-flip entries through identical filters, stops, targets, sizing and
costs, rebuilt at n≈60 (367 trials):

| pct | PF |
|---|---|
| 50th | 0.905 |
| 75th | 1.122 |
| 90th | 1.370 |
| **95th** | **1.544** |
| 99th | 2.039 |

**Our 1.495 sits at the 93.5th percentile — below the 95th.** Random entry
beats it roughly one run in fifteen.

The width is the lesson. At n=60 the noise band runs from 0.905 to 2.039.
An earlier null built from ~810-trade samples gave 0.782–1.052, and using
THAT band here would have declared 1.495 a huge win. Profit-factor error
scales with 1/sqrt(n); a null must be rebuilt at the sample size being
judged. This is now enforced in stress_test.py.

### Gate 2 — deflated Sharpe: FAIL

SR/trade +0.1802 on n=60.

| trials | E[max SR] from noise | DSR |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.0000 | 0.925 |
| 100 | 0.3750 | 0.060 |
| 370 (what the search actually ran) | 0.4387 | **0.019** |

Even granting the impossible fiction that only ONE configuration was ever
tried, DSR is 0.925 — still short of 0.95. At the true trial count it is
0.019.

### Gate 3 — buy and hold: FAIL

**+100.42% versus +16.96%** on the identical window. Gold doubled. The
strategy captured a sixth of that while carrying execution risk, 60 round
trips and a live-money failure mode that buy-and-hold does not have.

### What this actually establishes

**The config is rejected.** But the more useful finding is structural: a
strategy trading 60 times in 2.67 years CANNOT be validated on this data.
The noise band at that sample size is wider than any edge we could
plausibly detect. Selectivity that produces a thin sample is not rigour —
it is untestability.

That reframes the next step. The requirement is not "a better entry
rule", it is **a strategy that trades often enough to be measurable**.
Multi-Voice produced 521 trades in six months, which over this window
would be several thousand — enough that its noise band would be narrow
enough to see through. It is the only engine that ever cleared PF 1.0 and
it has never been tested out of sample.

### Precedent

This is the first time a promising number was killed BEFORE it entered the
ledger as a win. PF 3.656 and PF 1.783 were both celebrated first and
retracted later. The three gates are now mandatory and automated.

## Cross-validation: the Python engine is trustworthy (2026-07-31)

The user ran gold_trend_trailing.pine on TradingView over Feb 2 – Jul 31
2026 with both direction settings. Against the Python engine on the same
window and parameters (entry 50, trail 8.0 ATR):

| | n | WR | PF | net | max DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **long only** — Python | 38 | 26.32% | 0.567 | −5.14% | 7.14% |
| **long only** — TradingView | 38 | 26.32% | 0.550 | −5.72% | 7.65% |
| **long+short** — Python | 58 | 31.03% | 1.444 | +6.94% | 3.44% |
| **long+short** — TradingView | 56 | 33.93% | 1.486 | +7.57% | 4.19% |

Long-only agrees **exactly** on trade count and win rate. The residual P&L
difference is fill and cost modelling; the ±2 trades on long+short is a
feed difference (OANDA spot vs the LSE export).

**This is the cross-validation that backtrader could not provide.** That
attempt failed on an execution-model mismatch and was marked INCOMPLETE.
TradingView turned out to be the second independent implementation, and it
agrees. Everything measured in `backtest/` can now be treated as
representative of what the Pine strategy will actually do — including the
6.7-year results, the random nulls and the deflated-Sharpe audit.

It also confirms the regime finding from the live side rather than only in
research: in a window where gold fell 15.8%, long-only returned −5.72% and
long+short returned +7.57%.

## Key levels as the entry/exit trigger (2026-07-31)

User request: *"i want you to enter and exit the trade on key levels.
reverse the signal as it touches the key level."*

Levels are `backtest/levels.py` — the port of the same SpacemanBTC module
the Pine host embeds, so every level tested here is a line drawn on the
chart. Data: XAUUSD 15m, 157,366 bars, 2019-12-01 → 2026-07-30.
Train = first 80% (125,892 bars), OOS = last 20% (31,474 bars).

### 1. Level touch as the ENTRY — no edge, in either direction

`backtest/kl_reverse.py`, always-in book, full period, all 18 levels.
`reverse` = fade the level (the user's spec); `break` = trade with it.

| config | n | WR | PF | net | max DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| reverse, gap 1 ATR | 11,726 | 56.8% | 0.835 | −88.4% | 88.5% |
| reverse, gap 6 ATR | 3,049 | 36.2% | 0.934 | −43.6% | 50.1% |
| break, gap 1 ATR | 13,690 | 38.7% | 0.895 | −81.3% | 82.6% |
| break, gap 6 ATR | 2,768 | 34.9% | 0.952 | −33.9% | 54.1% |

Costs are not the explanation. With commission and slippage set to **zero**
every configuration still sits on PF 1.00: reverse 0.984 / 0.951 / 1.000,
break 1.017 / 0.987 / 1.003 at gaps 1/3/6. A key-level touch carries no
directional information at 15m on this instrument — in either direction.
Adding the EMA2000 + slope gate lifts the best to PF 1.060, still far
below the breakout engine's 1.333 on the same data and settings.

**Conclusion: entry stays on the breakout.** Not shipped as a mode.

### 2. Level touch as the EXIT — small, consistent, counter-trend only

`backtest/trend.py` with `kl=` (new): baseline engine, entry unchanged,
exit at the nearest drawn level ahead of the position. Settings entry 50,
trail 6.0 ATR, SMA 750, EMA 2000, slope 200, short risk 0.75.

| config | TRAIN PF / net | OOS PF / net |
|---|---|---|
| baseline, no key levels | 1.244 / +85.6% | 1.580 / +29.3% |
| **close 75% at level, shorts only** | **1.289 / +89.7%** | **1.610 / +29.1%** |
| close 100% at level, shorts only | 1.246 / +82.3% | 1.579 / +29.0% |
| REVERSE at level, shorts only | 1.244 / +81.2% | 1.588 / +29.0% |
| **REVERSE at level, both sides** | **0.932 / −14.8%** | 1.521 / +20.7% |
| JEAFX quarter grid, shorts only | 1.297 / +92.3% | 1.598 / +28.5% |

Full period, 921 trades: baseline PF 1.333 / +152.5% / DD 13.6% →
75% level exit shorts-only PF **1.379 / +155.9% / DD 12.3%**.

Three findings, all consistent train and OOS:

1. **The reversal the user asked for is the worst config tested.** On both
   sides it turns a +85.6% train result into −14.8%. It is shipped as a
   toggle, defaulted OFF, with these numbers in its tooltip.
2. **The asymmetry rule holds a third time.** Acting on the level on both
   sides collapses the full period to PF 1.023 / +5.9%. Counter-trend side
   only is the best config measured.
3. **Real chart levels ≈ the synthetic quarter grid** (1.289 vs 1.297
   train, 1.610 vs 1.598 OOS). The chart levels are now the default
   because they are the ones the user can see, not because they measure
   better.

Sensitivity is flat, not knife-edge: tolerance 0.05–0.50 ATR moves train
PF 1.272–1.296; take fraction 60–90% moves it 1.282–1.296.

**Caveat that belongs on this row:** the gain over baseline (+0.045 PF on
train, +0.030 OOS) is small relative to the ~30 configurations swept to
find it. Treat it as "does not hurt, is what you asked for, and is
directionally consistent across both halves" — not as a validated edge.

---

## Confluence: key levels + a second SMA, merged (2026-07-31)

User request: *"i was keep key levels and SMA 2000 also a confluence. see
what can u do and merge them together."*

Same data and split as the row above. `backtest/trend.py` gained
`sma2_len` (a second, longer SMA gate) and `kl_entry_atr` (entry only when
a drawn level is within N ATR). Baseline verified unchanged first: still
PF 1.333 / +152.5% / 921 trades, five accounting tests passing.

### Which merge actually works

Common settings: entry 50, trail 6.0 ATR, EMA2000 regime + 200-bar slope,
short risk 0.75, key-level exit 75% counter-trend-only.

| confluence | TRAIN PF / net / DD | OOS PF / net / DD |
|---|---|---|
| SMA750 only (previous ship) | 1.289 / +89.7% / 12.3% | 1.610 / +29.1% / 8.3% |
| SMA2000 *instead of* 750 | 1.181 / +55.2% / 15.0% | 1.631 / +26.6% / 7.9% |
| **SMA750 AND SMA2000** | **1.335 / +93.0% / 9.6%** | **1.624 / +25.0% / 8.1%** |
| + level within 0.5 ATR of entry | 1.347 / +73.6% / 9.1% | 1.630 / +21.2% / 6.6% |
| + level within 1.0 ATR of entry | 1.284 / +66.8% / 10.6% | 1.615 / +24.2% / 7.0% |
| + level within 2.0 ATR of entry | 1.341 / +93.4% / 9.8% | 1.590 / +23.7% / 8.6% |

Full period, the layers stacked:

| build | n | WR | PF | net | maxDD | ret/DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| breakout + trail only | 921 | 36.3% | 1.333 | +152.52% | 13.61% | 11.21 |
| + key-level exit, shorts only | 922 | 38.5% | 1.379 | +155.89% | 12.30% | 12.68 |
| **+ slow SMA must agree** | **863** | **40.1%** | **1.421** | **+157.65%** | **9.63%** | **16.36** |
| + level near entry (rejected) | 822 | 39.3% | 1.385 | +120.94% | 10.57% | 11.44 |

### What this says

1. **The confluence is a drawdown filter, not a return generator.** Return
   moved +155.9% → +157.7%; drawdown fell 12.30% → 9.63%. Return per unit
   of drawdown went 12.68 → 16.36. That is the whole effect.
2. **It is the AGREEMENT that works, not the slower average.** SMA2000
   replacing SMA750 is worse on train (1.181 vs 1.289). Requiring only one
   of the two to agree is much worse (1.149). Requiring both is best.
3. **Key levels do not work as an entry confluence** — same conclusion as
   the row above reached from the entry-signal side, now reached again
   from the filter side. Full-period net drops +157.7% → +120.9%, and the
   effect is the same at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ATR, so it is not a tuning
   problem. Shipped as a toggle, defaulted OFF.
4. **Sizing up on extra agreement was tested and rejected.** Requiring 1 of
   2 and paying +100% size for the second lifts train net to +146.1% but
   takes drawdown to 21.8% and PF down to 1.197 — leverage, not edge.

**Caveat:** ~20 configurations were swept here on top of the ~30 in the
row above. The confluence gain (+0.042 PF full period) is small against
that trial count. What supports it beyond the point estimate is that the
drawdown reduction shows up in both halves and in the full period, and
that the mechanism — two horizons disagreeing marks the choppy middle —
is not a free parameter.
