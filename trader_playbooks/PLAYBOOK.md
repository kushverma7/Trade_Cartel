=== SCALP SETUPS ===

1. **Session Trendline Breakout** (flagship)
   - Conditions: XAUUSD 5m, OLS trendline (lookback 22), London 03:00-05:00
     or NY-open 08:30-11:00 NY time only
   - Entry: close breaks optimized trendline; Stop: 2x ATR(14); Target: 4x ATR
   - Evidence: PF 3.656 backtest. Files: strategies/trendline_breakout_fixed.pine
   - Sizing: A-setup. Confluence upgrade: aligned tier-A candle pattern.

2. **HTF Wall Reclaim** (Reversal Sniper v3 — unproven, testing)
   - Conditions: flush >= 0.3 ATR beyond prev day/week H/L or Asia range,
     then reclaim close back inside within 5 bars
   - Entry: reclaim close; Stop: behind 4-bar extreme; TP 1R/2R split
   - Status: v3 awaiting backtest. v2 variant RETIRED (see What's Not Working).

3. **CPI Confirm-Continuation** (news harness)
   - Conditions: 8:30 ET event candle >= 2x ATR50; later close breaks its extreme
   - Entry: break close; Stop: opposite extreme + 0.2 ATR; TP 1.5R; time exit
   - Status: mode won the decisive 2025-26 CPI days in event match; needs tester run.

=== WHAT'S WORKING NOW ===
- Session filter (B1) — apply everywhere by default
- Flip execution on trendline signals (always-in) — stats pending user backtest

=== WHAT'S NOT WORKING ===
- Auto 5m supply/demand zone reclaims (PF 0.731, retired)
- Naked patterns, 24/7 trading, high trade counts

=== MARKET CONDITIONS ===
- Regime notes (2026-07): gold whipsawed by Iran conflict + inflation swings
  ($4,594 Jan -> $5,177 Mar -> $4,164 Jun). Event-driven regime: session
  discipline and news windows matter more than trend-following.

=== MASTER ENGINE (final synthesis, 2026-07-19) ===
indicators/trade_cartel_master_engine.pine
- Core: proven trendline breakout (22) + optional H7 full-body confirm
- Confluence vote 0-12: session [B1] +2, out-of-balance regime [PBD] +2,
  tier-A candle [Nison] +2, aggression [Valentini] +2, VWAP side (not
  beyond 2SD) +2, fresh level [H8] +2
- Grades: 8+ = A+, 5-7 = B, below = suppressed (grey x with tooltip)
- Hard vetoes: opposing tier-A candle, recent CVD divergence against,
  8:25-8:45 ET news window, over-rejected level
- Dashboard shows all layer states live; alerts per grade

=== UPDATED RULES ===
- Flat into CPI/8:30 prints; trade the confirmation after (B3)
- Every strategy ships with: non-repainting math, realistic costs,
  per-scenario alerts on bar close
- Conviction scoring (0-12) maps to size: 0-4 no trade, 5-7 = 0.5%,
  8-10 = 1-2%, 11-12 = 2-4% (Cognitive Architecture, Profit Engine)
- Scale-out standard: 1/3 @ 1R, 1/3 @ 2R, 1/3 runner w/ BE stop
